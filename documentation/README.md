This directory contains the documentation which accompanies the environment setup process.

It is (presently only) one LaTeX document, for which the source is the \*.tex file in this directory and its compiled (using PDFLaTeX) output is the \*.pdf file.

When compiling this yourself, please make sure you have the required LaTeX packages installed; I would recommend using TeXLive due to the robustness of its offerings.  Furthermore, be sure to also clone any required class (\*.cls) and/or style (\*.sty) files in addition to any images or other files which are included in the document.
